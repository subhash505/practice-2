I ordered a laptop from Amazon that was listed as brand new, but what I received is clearly a used and tampered device. This is not just a case of poor service—this is fraud.

The most shocking part is that the Recycle Bin on the laptop contains files dated March, which clearly proves that the laptop was previously used months before I even placed the order. This is indisputable evidence that the product is not new as falsely advertised. Selling a used product as new is intentionally deceptive and completely unacceptable.

Amazon and the seller are both responsible for this serious lapse. This is a clear violation of consumer rights and feels like a deliberate act to cheat the customer out of a large sum of money. I demand an immediate full refund or a genuine brand-new replacement, and I also request strict action against the seller. Amazon must be held accountable for allowing such fraudulent sellers on its platform.

Such actions are not just disappointing—they are dangerous and erode consumer trust. This matter should be treated with utmost urgency.
